## Thesis Information

**Title:** Surplus as Nature, Surplus as Politics
**Subtitle:** Physiocracy, Sovereignty, and the Political Life of Economic Excess
**Author:** Sebastian Alexander
**Institution:** The American University of Paris — History, Law & Society Capstone
**Year:** 2026

## Abstract

Economic surplus is often treated as a neutral byproduct of production, yet historically it has functioned as a political claim about how societies ought to be organized. This thesis traces how surplus was conceptualized and naturalized in eighteenth-century physiocratic thought, beginning with François Quesnay's Tableau Économique, and examines how it became destabilized and politicized through later thinkers including Adam Smith and Karl Marx. What began as a claim about nature became a claim about power.

### Chapter III: The Debate — Usury & the Moral Transition
**Period:** 13th-16th century
**Protagonists:** Thomas Aquinas vs John Calvin
**Audio:** `chapter3.mp3` (Debate Narrative.mp3) ✅
**Key Themes:**
- **Aquinas (13th c.):** Money is sterile; charging interest is selling time, which belongs to God
- **Calvin (1545):** Money can buy a farm, therefore shares the farm's fertility
- Calvin's shift: decoupled "usury" (exploitation) from "interest" (legitimate profit)
- Moral transition enabling modern finance: "We didn't solve the moral problem of usury—we just renamed it 'Finance'"
- Catalyst for political ontology of surplus

**Suggested Image:** Medieval money changers painting or side-by-side portraits of Aquinas and Calvin
